"""
This code will be the best thing I have ever done so far.
I was always wondering how people do encrpytion despite the fact that is not an encryption, it is something like that.
I will turn ASCII characters into Binary then Decimal and finally ASCII again. which is called as Base64 Encoding.
I am still thinking of the way to do it but I will find out.
