# keylogger-not_finished
A Keylogger that will encode the collected keystrokes into base64. Still trying to find a way to send the keystrokes to desired device. There is lots of ways but I didn't want to use these. So it isn't finished yet.

Yes, as if it's not enough that thousands of people did the same thing I did it too. But the purpose is not to make somthing that isn't done before.
I don't think that you will use this code but just in case I need to remind you: There is really better codes that does the same shit.
